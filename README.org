* Wait, what are dotfiles?
Dotfiles are configuration files or folders stored on the home directory of your GNU/Linux  system. The files or/and folders usually start with a period. It's a great way to backup configs incase something happens to your system, or you just need to reinstall.

* Using my dotfiles
It's quick an easy! Just clone my repo and you're done!
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/charged1/dotfiles
#+end_src
Then navigate to the location of the clone, and move the config file of your choice to your config directory.
Make sure you backup your old configs, if you have one!

* How I manage my Dotfiles
To manage my Dotfiles, I use the  "Git Bare Method". This is an easy way of managing your dotfiles, without cluttering your home directory with symlinks! You can learn more [[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles][here]].

** Why did I remake my Dotfiles?
I completely restarted my Dotfiles repo because I used to use the symlink method, and I had lots of issues sorting out what goes where, and some files I rewrite completely, won't even symlink because they have too many files connected! The Git Bare Method has saved me so I now use it.
