# `.extra,`what's this?
This folder contains extra files and folders other than my dotfiles, which are too small to put in its own repo, so I leave it here.

# Running a script
There are scripts located in the [scripts](https://gitlab.com/charged1/dotfiles/-/tree/main/.config/alacritty) folder. <br>
To run a script, simply navigate to the directory containing your desired script, and run these commands:

```bash
# Make the file executable
chmod +x [filename].sh
./[filename.sh]
```
`[filename]` is the script name.

**Note: These scripts may not work on your system**, as the programs installed on your system might be different to mine, and as of May 7th, 2022 I haven't clarified what each script does. <br> <br>
Scripts were created with the intention of making my life easier by being able to run scripts, instead of typing tons of commands, who wants to do that?
